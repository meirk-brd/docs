Agent Builder includes starter templates that preconfigure system prompts, tools, and triggers for common use cases like tracking Linear boards, summarizing Slack channels, and managing email. Use a template as a starting point and customize any aspect to fit your needs.

## How to use templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a template">
    In Agent Builder, choose a template that matches your use case (for example, email summarization, Slack digests, or CRM follow‑ups).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review tools and prompts">
    Each template comes with an initial system prompt and a set of tools. Adjust the prompt to your tone and workflow, and enable or disable tools as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add triggers (optional)">
    For scheduled or event‑driven behavior, add a cron schedule or connect a [trigger](/langsmith/agent-builder#triggers) (for example, Slack or Gmail).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and iterate">
    Run the agent, review outputs, and refine prompts or tools. You can add [sub‑agents](/langsmith/agent-builder#sub-agents) for more complex tasks.
  </Step>
</Steps>
